This project was done as part of my Advanced Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)
                    class where I was tasked with recreating the experiment done by Tovi Grossman
                    and Ravin Balakrishnan using Unity and C#. The aim was to measure the efficiency of a users input
                    using different pointer methods. In this case, I compared the accuracy and speed of a
                    bubble cursor compared to the pointer cursor. <br/><br/>
                    The experiment involved creating a 2D area in Unity with targets for the user to click and
                    distractors to make it more of a challenge. The goal was to gather data from their
                    performance, which was then analyzed to evaluate which cursor type was more efficient.
